# the schedule consists of stations and programmes.
# - a programme is a three-tuple: ( identifier, schedule, duration), where
#   - identifier is a string (needs not be unique). It is used in logging outputs and in combination with the station identifier to determine the output paths for recordings
#   - schedule is a parsable schedule string
#   - duration is an integer indicating the length of the recording in minutes
# - a station is a three-tuple: ( identifier, m3u url, programmes)
#   - identifier is a string (needs not be unique). It is used in logging outputs and in combination with the programme identifier to determine the output paths for recordings
#   - m3u url is a string containing the url of the m3u files
#   - programmes is a list of programmes
